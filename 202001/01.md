#### What is the biggest lie that Chinese government tells its people?<br>中国政府对他的人民所说过的最大的谎言是什么样的？

While I was at primary school, there was an article in my Chinese textbook introducing the beautiful sceneries and hospitable people in Taiwan. In fact, the Chinese government has always been telling their people that Taiwanese are very friendly: we share the same culture and we are just like brothers and sisters being seperated for some reasons.    
在我上小学的时候，我的中文课本上有一篇文章介绍台湾美丽的景色和好客的人民。事实上，中国政府一直在告诉民众，台湾同胞非常友好：我们有相同的文化、亲如兄弟姐妹，只是因为某些愿意而被分隔。

Most of the Chinese believed that kind of thing until they really see what the Taiwanese say about Mainland and Mainlanders on Facebook, Twitter, PTT etc.    
大多数中国人都相信这些描述，直到他们在 Facebook、Twitter、PTT 等地方看到台湾人实际上是如何评价大陆和大陆人的。

I think that this would be one of the biggest lies that the government has ever told to its people.    
我想这就是政府曾经对它的人民所讲过的最大的谎言。
